## Latest version — 3.17

[Download Raidex 3.17 for Windows x64](https://github.com/c4Luffy/Raidex-Downloads/releases/latest/download/Raidex.CoC.Automation-win-x64.zip) · [SHA-256 checksum](https://github.com/c4Luffy/Raidex-Downloads/releases/latest/download/Raidex.CoC.Automation-win-x64.zip.sha256) · [What's new](https://github.com/c4Luffy/Raidex-Downloads/releases/tag/v3.17)

Raidex 3.17 fixes Builder Base attacks that stopped before deploying troops in Area 2, targets the correct Builder upgrade button, and makes the Home Running and Stop safely controls clearer. Hero upgrade priority from 3.16 is included.

## Set up hero priority

1. Open **Automation → Home Village** for the profile you want to change.
2. Turn on **Hero upgrades** and choose **Set order**.
3. Add the heroes you want, with your most important hero first. You can choose several heroes and give each profile a different order.

Raidex tries them when their Elixir or Dark Elixir reaches 90% of your saved storage limit. If none can be upgraded, it keeps the builder free for heroes instead of starting another building or wall upgrade.

## Builder Base fix

Raidex recognizes the boat on the live Home Village screen. In a Builder Base battle, Area 1 can reach 100% before the army moves to Area 2. Raidex now waits for the Area 2 troop-planning screen before checking the returned cards. It also presses the green resource button on two-choice upgrade confirmations, including Battle Machine.

## Set up account rotation

1. Save each Clash account in Supercell ID on the same emulator, and make a Raidex profile for each account.
2. Open **Profiles → Manage profile** and save that account's **Clash player tag**. Do this for every profile. Profile names can be anything.
3. For every profile, assign the same emulator. In **Automation → Home Village**, set the Gold, Elixir, and Dark Elixir storage limits, and turn on **Home Village attacks** and **Wall upgrades**.
4. Under **Full storage action**, choose **Account rotation** for each profile. On Home, choose the account you want to start with and press **Start Raidex**.

If Raidex cannot find or confirm the next account, it stops safely.

## Other features

The **Automation → Events** tab now has the Treasure Hunt chest and Equipment Blast Medal Event switches. More options can be added as Raidex supports new events.

2. Keep the Engine and Assets folders beside Raidex CoC Automation.exe.
