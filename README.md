[Download Raidex 3.35 for Windows x64](https://github.com/c4Luffy/Raidex-Downloads/releases/latest/download/Raidex.CoC.Automation-win-x64.zip) · [SHA-256 checksum](https://github.com/c4Luffy/Raidex-Downloads/releases/latest/download/Raidex.CoC.Automation-win-x64.zip.sha256) · [What's new](https://github.com/c4Luffy/Raidex-Downloads/releases/tag/v3.35)

Raidex 3.35 keeps support reports available when screenshot capture times out and makes manual reports follow the displayed five-minute cooldown. Automatic reports retain their existing duplicate protection. The setup guide now explains when activation is needed and where to find your license key.

## Choose building upgrade order

Open **Automation → Home Village** or **Automation → Builder Base** and use **Set order** beside Building upgrades. Enter only the English building name, without a level or count. Uppercase and lowercase both work. Raidex tries your names in order, then other suggested buildings when the chosen ones are unavailable. Turn on **Skip Town Hall** in Home Village or **Skip Builder Hall** in Builder Base to exclude that main building.

In Builder Base, **Hero upgrades → Set order** lets you choose Battle Machine and Battle Copter. Raidex checks the selected name again before spending resources.

## Skip Town Hall upgrades

Open **Automation → Home Village** for the profile you want to change, then turn on **Skip Town Hall**. Raidex will consider other suggested buildings while leaving Town Hall out. If it cannot confirm a building's name, it skips that upgrade.

## Set up hero priority

1. Open **Automation → Home Village** for the profile you want to change.
2. Turn on **Hero upgrades** and choose **Set order**.
3. Add the heroes you want, with your most important hero first. You can choose several heroes and give each profile a different order.

Raidex tries them when their Elixir or Dark Elixir reaches 90% of your saved storage limit. If none can be upgraded, it keeps the builder free for heroes instead of starting another building or wall upgrade.

## Builder Base fix

Raidex recognizes the boat on the live Home Village screen. In a Builder Base battle, Area 1 can reach 100% before the army moves to Area 2. Raidex waits for the Area 2 troop-planning screen and returned cards, then uses the battle timer to confirm the first troop was placed before sending the rest. It also presses the green resource button on two-choice upgrade confirmations, including Battle Machine.

## Set up account rotation

1. Save each Clash account in Supercell ID on the same emulator, and make a Raidex profile for each account.
2. Open **Profiles → Manage profile** and save that account's **Clash player tag**. Do this for every profile. Profile names can be anything.
3. For every profile, assign the same emulator. In **Automation → Home Village**, set the Gold, Elixir, and Dark Elixir storage limits, and turn on **Home Village attacks** and **Wall upgrades**.
4. Under **Full storage action**, choose **Account rotation** for each profile. On Home, choose the account you want to start with and press **Start Raidex**.

If Raidex cannot find or confirm the next account, it stops safely.
